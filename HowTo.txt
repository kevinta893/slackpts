How to use

=============

How to setup:
1. Run the server once to generate the neccesary files. 
2. Shutdown the server to begin configuration
3. Open "server_config". Modify the webhook-url field by providing the the Slack incoming webhook given by that integration's setup screen.
4. Modify other fields as necessiary
5. Run server again to begin using on Slack.




How to use:

A. Registering

Each user must register their userID in order to use the server. This is simply done using the /register command. 
Since everyone has a unique userID on Slack that is normally hidden, each user will have only one account on the server. 

If a user changes their username on Slack, then they simply need to use /register again to update their name
on the server. This is to allow freedom of username changes without losing data.



B. Tipping

To tip a user with a single unit of point, simply use the command /tip [username] . You can not tip yourself.



C. Checking points

To check the number of points you currently have, use command /check .

To check the number of points that someone else has, use command /check [username] .
